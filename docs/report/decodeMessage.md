# Task: decodeMessage

The task pops the oldest message from the receiving queue, and writes it into the system state’s “last received message” variable.

## Task type and functions

This task is a thread, but it is triggered by the availability of messages on the queue rather than a fixed interval. It works in tandem with CAN_RX_ISR and is analogous to CAN_TX_Task; the ISR means that all messages received will be placed into the queue since it must finish, while the decoding thread can block and yield to other tasks while waiting for messages, thereby freeing up the CPU.

This task calls the following functions:

- xQueueReceive: copies a message from the receiving queue into a buffer

## Task interval and execution time
Similar to the CAN_TX_TASK, the initiation interval for the `decodeMessageTask` was found by examining how long it waits for the messages from `msgInQ` so that it does not fill up. As the task's function is to remove the messages from the queue by transmitting them via the CAN protocol, the interval can be found by seeing the duration of each CAN frame transmission, multiplied by the length of the queue. Each CAN frame takes 0.7ms to execute, and the length of the queue is 36, which gives 25.2ms required to empty. For the accumulated execution time, it can be calculated by using the worst case execution time of 0.009875ms, which gives
```math
0.009875 \times 36 = 355.5 \micro s
```

## Mesurement Methodology
1. Initial Setup:
    1. Disable all other thread tasks and ISRs through preprocessor directives to isolate the `decodeMessageTask`.
    2. Increased the size of `msgOutQ` to 1000 to prevent the task from blocking.
    3. Configured a loop at the end of the `setup` function to execute the task 32 times for averaging the execution time.
2. Worst-case configuration
    1. Pre-filled the `msgInQ` queue before executing the loop to ensure `decodeMessageTask` could execute without being blocked by `xQueueReceive`.

| Initiation Interval (ms) | Execution Time (ms) |
| --- | --- |
| - | 0.009875 |

## Data/resource use and synchronisation

This task uses the resource msgInQ, which is the queue of all received messages. The synchronisation of this queue is managed by FreeRTOS.

The task also writes to global variable sysState.RX_Message. This is accessed in a thread-safe manner by using a mutex to block other accesses. Only the copying of the local message buffer into this variable is contained within the mutex to reduce the length of blocking time.

## Blocking dependencies and deadlock risk

decodeMessage blocks all other tasks that use sysState when it takes the mutex, and is in turn blocked when other tasks lock the same mutex. However, there is no risk of deadlock, since all functions that locks a mutex will always unlock it, and no blocking statements occur while the mutex is locked (since mutexes are only ever locked while variable accessing occurs, and not for any variable processing).

decodeMessage does not block while waiting for new items on the queue, and has no other dependencies. Therefore, there is no risk of deadlock (since a dependency cycle needs at least one connection of each of the “is blocked by” and “is blocking” types on every graph node).
