# Task: Receiving CAN messages

This task sets up new memory space for variables used by its callees, then calls CAN_RX, which loads a received message into RX_Message_ISR. It then stores this message into the program’s internal queue, to be handled by the decoder, later.

## Task type and execution time
The task `CAN_RX_ISR` places received messages onto the msgInQ. The worst case then becomes when the queue is filling up. As the length of the queue is 36, and each CAN frame takes 0.7ms, the product of it, 25.2ms, creates the worst case execution time. The accumulated execution time then becomes 

```math
36 \times 0.99333 = 35.76 ms
```

## Measurement methodology

1. Initial Setup:
    1. Disable all other thread tasks and ISRs through preprocessor directives to isolate the `CAN_RX_ISR` function.
    2. Enabled loopback mode on the CAN module to allow for self-reception of messages, mimicking a full mailbox scenario without external CAN network traffic.
    3. Pre-filled the CAN mailboxes by executing `CAN_TX()` three times before the measurement loop to ensure the function won’t block while waiting for the queue to fill up.
    4. Configured a loop at the end of the `setup` function to execute the task 3 times and time it.
2. Worst-case configuration
    1. No changes needed to be made to this function for testing.
