# Embedded Systems: Synthesiser

A second year group project for a module on Embedded Systems.\
The goal was to write all the practical code for a synthesiser that stacks with other synths, 
including keypress detection, noise generation, communication, etc.




### TODOs

Things that I wanted to improve on after the coursework deadline:

0. Write more in this README :p
1. Break this code into a properly structured project
2. Implement functional and scalable communications
   - current communication protocol is lackluster and buggy, to say the least
   - 8-bit, on/off stuff, implement main/sub, dominance establishment protocol
3. Fix tone volumes, due to the nature of the waveforms (and maybe gen.), some sound a lot quieter
4. Improve UI, remove bugs, improve readability, make note display uniform
5. Implement sound enveloping (toggled by volume knob)
6. Integrate Playback feature (MITeo21's branch)
7. More stuff?
